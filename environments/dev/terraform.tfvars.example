# Example terraform.tfvars file for development environment
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize as needed
# IMPORTANT: Add terraform.tfvars to .gitignore to avoid committing sensitive data

# Seed Data Configuration (non-sensitive data)
# You can override the entire object or use the defaults from variables.tf
# seed_data = {
#   salon = {
#     name        = "My Custom Salon"
#     street      = "123 Main Street"
#     city        = "London"
#     postal_code = "SW1A 1AA"
#   }
#   owner = {
#     email      = "owner@example.com"
#     first_name = "John"
#     last_name  = "Doe"
#     full_name  = "John Doe"
#   }
# }

# Seed Owner Password - THIS IS THE ONLY REQUIRED OVERRIDE!
# Just override the password, all other seed data will use defaults
seed_owner_password = "your-secure-password-here"  # CHANGE THIS!

# Or override individual top-level variables as needed:
# ecs_desired_count = 2
# ecs_task_cpu = "512"
# ecs_task_memory = "1024"

# Sensitive variables (keep these secure!)
# django_secret_key = "your-django-secret-key"
# database_password = "your-database-password"
# twilio_auth_token = "your-twilio-auth-token"
# twilio_account_sid = "your-twilio-account-sid"
